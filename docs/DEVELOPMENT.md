## How to release Python distribution packages locally

Python packages are released using
[cibuildwheel](https://pypi.org/project/cibuildwheel/). First step is to setup
it. Usually it means setup docker and install the package from PyPi (see [setup
instructions](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/setup/#local)).

There are additional preparations to be made before running it. First of all
`libhyperonc` library should be built and installed in a build environment. By
default library downloads and install version from the `main` branch of the
`trueagi-io/hyperon-experimental` repository. If one need to use the custom
branch then it is done by passing custom parameters to the
`install-hyperonc.sh` script which is called using
[CIBW_BEFORE_ALL](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#before-all)
environment variable:
```
export CIBW_BEFORE_ALL='sh -c "./python/install-hyperonc.sh -u <git-repo-url> -r <git-branch>"'
```

One should replace `<git-repo-url>` and `<git-branch>` by the repo URL and
branch which are used in release. It is required because `cibuildwheel` uses
isolated docker container for each kind of platform it supports. Only code of
the Python package is copied into container automatically. Code of the
`libhyperonc` library should be downloaded from outside. It means one need to
have the code in some repo accessible from the container before starting
release. The simplest way is to push the changes in your GitHub repo fork.

Also one can start from building the only platform to quickly check whether
release works. This can be done using
[CIBW_BUILD](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/options/#build-skip)
variable:
```
export CIBW_BUILD=cp37-manylinux_x86_64
```

After exporting the variables above one can start release by executing
`cibuildwheel` from the `./python` directory of the repo. See [cibuildwheel
documentation](https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/) for details.

## How to update the version

Usually it is needed after releasing the artifacts or before making a test
release.

There are three locations to update:
- [/Cargo.toml](/Cargo.toml) file:
  - `workspace.package.version` property
  - `workspace.dependencies.hyperon.version` property
- [/python/VERSION](/python/VERSION) file

All three locations should contain the same version.

## How to release binaries

Use [Create a new release
link](https://github.com/trueagi-io/hyperon-experimental/releases/new) on the
main page of the GitHub repo. Press `Choose a tag` control and type new tag
which should be in form of `v<next-version>` (for example if next version is
`0.1.7` then tag is `v0.1.7`). Next version should be identical to versions
which are written in locations mentioned in [How to update the
version](#how-to-update-the-version) instruction. After typing the tag press
`Create new tag on publish`. Now press `Generate release notes` button. It will
automatically fill the `Release title` and `Release description` fields. Tick
`Set as a pre-release` checkbox if needed and press `Publish release` button.
Now you have published new GitHub release and triggered a job to build release
artifacts.

After release job is finished one need to approve publishing artifacts to the
PyPi repository. Before approving one can download and test Python wheels
built. To check the job status go the `Actions/release-pyhon` page, and select
last workflow run. Links to the archives with the artifacts are located at the
bottom of the page.

If distribution wheels are good then one can approve the publishing process. At
the top of the workflow run page there are two blocks `Publish to Test PyPi`
and `Publish to PyPi`. First press `Publish to Test PyPi` block approve it and
wait for publishing. It is critical to start from Test PyPi because release
cannot be removed from the PyPi after publishing.

After release is published check it can be installed executing:
```
python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ hyperon
```
Check that the latest published version was downloaded and installed. If you
are making a test release then you should not publish it to the PyPi. If it is
a production release then proceed with `Publish to PyPi` block.

## How to check release job in fork

First you need to select the test release version. It should contain an
additional version digit after the latest officially released version. Let's
say the latest released version is `0.1.7`. Then the test release version
should be `0.1.7.x` for instance `0.1.7.1`. Start from 1 and increment it after
each release you published successfully.

Make a separate branch to release the code. It is not necessary but it is
highly recommended to not pollute the main branch of the fork. In order to be
able releasing from the branch one need to temporary make it default branch. It
is done by using GitHub repo `Settings/General/Default branch` control.

[Update the version](#how-to-update-the-version) in the branch to the test
release version you constructed. Commit and push this change in your test
branch. Now you are ready to make a test release. See [release
binaries instruction](#how-to-release-binaries).

After testing the release procedure remove the commit with version update from
your branch. And set default branch setting to the previous value.
