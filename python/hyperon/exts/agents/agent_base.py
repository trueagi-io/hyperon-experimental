'''
This is very preliminary and incomplete PoC version.
However, it is put to exts, because metta-motto depends on it.
Reagrding threading:
- Generic threading for metta can be introduced with
  parallel and sequential composition, for-comprehension, etc.
  Agents could be built on top of this functionality. However,
  this piece of code was driven by metta-motto demands.
- Two main cases for agents are:
  -- Immediate call with inputs to get outputs
  -- Asynchronous events and responses
  Supporting both cases in one implementation is more convenient,
  because both of them can be needed simultaneously in certain
  domains (e.g. metta-motto)
- Implementation can be quite different.
  -- Agents could be started explicitly
  -- They could inherint from StreamMethod
  -- Other methods could be called directly without StreamMethod wrapper
  All these nuances are to be fleshed out
